# Lutris Installer for Civilization II: Test of Time with Test of Time Patch Project

This file provides a Lutris install script for Civilzation II: Test of Time along with the Test of Time Patch Project (TOTPP) version 0.18.4.  It also provides the option to install my [Extended Music Patch](https://github.com/ProfGarfield/ExtendedMusicForTOTPP), which uses TOTPP's Lua integration to allow the player to play custom tracks as in game music.

I have not added this installer to any installer database.  I have no objection if someone else does this, but I am not responsible for any changes that may be made.
